Kort beskrivelse av applikasjon (5-10 setninger):
The application is an early prototype, that has now been styled, and saves
tickets in a database. You will still not be purchasing any actual tickets
through the webpage. You can also delete all the tickets with the delete button
if you so please. It uses SQL for the saving of the data, both with the help of a Java file, and with
the help of an SQL file. It also uses JavaScrip for general functionality, 
and HTML combined with Bootstrap for the styling. The
